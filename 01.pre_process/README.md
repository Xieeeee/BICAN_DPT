We have generated Droplet Paired-Tag data (active H3K27ac and repressive H3K27me3, i.e., MiniAtlas) for adult human cortex and cerebellum regions. This can not only help us refine the known enhancer candidates (cis-regultory candidates elements), but also contribute to our understanding how facultative heterochromatin plays a role in determining cell type specficities.
