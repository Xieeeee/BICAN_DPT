## Abstract
Understanding how cell-type-specific regulatory programs are established and maintained in the human brain requires direct measurement of chromatin states alongside transcription. Here, we present a large-scale single-cell multimodal atlas of the adult human brain generated by jointly profiling transcriptomes with active (H3K27ac) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone modifications. Across 18 brain regions, we profile over 750,000 nuclei spanning 160 cell types and integrate these data with single-cell chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, genome architecture, and spatial transcriptomic datasets. This integrated framework enables functional annotation of over 500,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements, distinguishing accessible, active, and Polycomb-repressed states with cell-type- and regional specificity. We further link enhancers to target genes, infer active or repressive gene regulatory networks in a cell-type-resolved manner, and functionally annotate chromatin loops, revealing neuron-enriched super long-range repressive interactions that preferentially engage developmental genes. By coupling these regulatory maps with genetic association data and sequence-based modeling, we prioritize noncoding variants, nominate their effector genes and vulnerable cell types across neuropsychiatric disorders. Cross-species integration further reveals an evolutionary asymmetry in regulatory grammar, with active programs broadly conserved and repressive programs more divergent. Together, this resource establishes a functional reference for the human brain regulatory architecture, providing a framework for interpreting noncoding genetic variants, understanding epigenetic memory, and linking chromatin states to brain structure and disease.

## Method
- We used Droplet Paired-Tag to jointly profile the nuclear transcriptome together with either H3K27ac or H3K27me3 in the same nucleus, with some optimizations compared to the [original method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-023-01060-1).

## Analysis
Details step to reproduce the analysis in our manuscript can be found in `02.analysis`.

## Data
- All processed and raw data will be available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and NeMO data archive once the manuscript is published
